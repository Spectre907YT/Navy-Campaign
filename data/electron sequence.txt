			`As you begin your landing approach, your ship's console beeps as you recieve a message from the control tower.`
			`	[Sergeant <last>, please redirect to the following coordinates- you are expected:]`
			`The message then lists a set of global coordinates about 20 miles to the west of the spaceport. Following the instructions, you redirect to the designated spot.`
			`After about two minutes, you see a old dilapidated warehouse with several concrete landing pads in front of it. You land at one of the pads and are greeted by a scientist in a white lab coat.`
			`	"Hello Sergeant! My name is John Withers," as he reaches out and shakes your hand. "I'm sure you've met my collegue, Dr. Heisenberg. He and I worked on the Heavy Laser back in the day. Now though, I have a new project, and for this one I'll be needing your help."`
			`As the mechanic refuels your ship, you follow the scientist to a shuttle waiting nearby. The shuttle starts moving, and heads into the warehouse, which seems much larger on the inside, large enough to fit a frigate at least, and is full of what looks to be prototypes of ships and weapons. The shuttle stops, and you all climb out.`
			`You follow the scientists down a short corridor leaving the main area of the warehouse, ending in a well-lit elevator lobby. John puts a code into a keypad, which opens the elevator doors. You walk in and it begins its descent. You step into a sleek lab, filled with scientists hunched over various displays and devices, of which you can guess the purpose of very few. John leads you down a long hallway to a sealed room, flanked by two marines with rifles. He pulls a key card out of his pocket, motions to one of the guards, who pulls out a card of his own, and they swipe them simultaneously. The door opens with a hiss and reveals a perfectly white room, and a table on which is seated a long device, which appears to be the latest from the Deep.`

			`John motions you over, saying, "Here it is! We call it the Electron Beam. Twenty tons of pure destruction- but it doesn't work. Because of increased pirate problems in Syndicate space, we are missing some crucial materials. We need you to get those materials before we can get this working. Your destination is Lodestone, in the Ankaa system. You will need twenty-one tons of cargo space free for this mission. We have some fun for you when you get back," he says with a wink. You nod assent, even though you are still enamored by this elegant weapon, but John pulls you away and ushers you back to your ship.`

			`Several minutes later, you spot the new location- a third warehouse. After going through the usual checks with security, you are escorted down to John's office.`
			`	"Sergeant! Good to see you again. I have once again been contracted to develop something- so naturally I called on your aid. What I have been asked to build this time is not a weapon of war- but a device of exploration. You see, the ramscoops we have today are quite outdated- and although it is quite rare to run out of fuel nowadays, it seems the Navy felt they wanted to increase the operational range of their ships."`
			`	"And so, as you might have guessed, I have been requested to build a new ramscoop. Here's my design."`
			scene "outfit/catalyctic ramscoop"
			`	"I've increased the filter quality, gotten a better collection funnel design, and increased the amount of funnels, all for a definite increase in efficiency. However, these are just the blueprints. We haven't even begun building it. And that's where you come in. You see, we need some special circuitry and rare metal filters that are only available on the Syndicate world of Antipode. The drawback is, that system, Matar, is so far south near the pirate systems that our typical Deep Sky escorts will not go, as they are 'over-extending themselves.' Whatever their real motives may be, I need you to escort two Auxiliaries that Logistics kindly let us use to Antipode and back. There shouldn't be too much trouble, but keep an eye out. Can you do this"`

And, even more to your chagrin, they all immediately begin turning towards you, some of them already training their turrets on you. Evidently, your convoy is the target of a coordinated attack...but for now you focus on something more important- your own survival.`

When you radio the control tower for your landing confirmation, a very impressed-sounding operator quickly replies, giving you your landing pad designation, and adds that the local government is very grateful for your assistance, and has relayed you an alotted compensation of 510,200 credits in order to express their gratitude. You politely thank him and proceed with your landing checks.`
